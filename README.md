## Course Description:
**This course has been authorized and developed in collaboration with Unity Technologies.**

Have you been struggling to learn C# programming with Unity? If this is the case, you've found the course you've been looking for! This course is intended for programmers at all levels, from beginner to advanced or professional. Sequential completion of the lessons is recommended for beginners, as it will teach you the fundamentals of coding through interactive challenges and problem solving techniques. 

The course progresses in difficulty, and when finished, you will have progressed from a novice C# developer to an advanced, job-ready C# developer. This course is intended for advanced or professional programmers as a reference guide to help you survive in the workplace. What are your thoughts on delegates and events? Check out the section of this course that is entirely dedicated to them and teaches you how to incorporate them into your projects.
